Individual Assignment #3

We'll keep Assignment 3 simple for the sake of prioritizing team work this week. I would like you to try out this exploratory JS assignment.

This assignment requires:
- an HTML file with 5 <div> elements. Those elements should all have unique ID attributes and be visible on the page to start. (Tip: set borders or background colors on empty divs)

- a JS file that has a minimum of 5 functions that perform some DOM manipulation of the 5 <div> elements. All javascript code should be included in the external js file. Your only script tag should be to import the external javascript into your html file.

- An eventListener should be used for every div. You must use the javascript addEventListener method NOT the html attributes; eg. onclick, onload, etc...

- You must use 5 different events. They can't all be "click". Explore the links above.

Feel free to keep this as simple or as complex as you like.
